# NimbusScouting

The Scouting App for the 2024 season, and hopefully later.

## How to run the app in development

First, you have to make sure that your computer has node.js and npm (Pretty sure it comes with it)

After, in vscode, you have to go into the project, open a powershell terminal, and type in "npm start"

Then, press enter to start the app.

Now, you will see many different options. You will want to first, press "s" while in the terminal to switch to expo mode.

Then, take out your phone, (It "works" on android... on occasion. Use apple for now please) and scan the qr code given. (Also, make sure your phone 
has the Expo Go app.)

This will take you to a webpage, where you want to click the bottom-most button that says "Open in Expo Go" or something similar.

Finally, this will take you to the expo app, and it will start to download the app there.

Keep in mind, when you do these last couple of steps, your phone and the device you are running the app's server on should be on the SAME NETWORK.

Hopefully it worked! If not, just ask me.
